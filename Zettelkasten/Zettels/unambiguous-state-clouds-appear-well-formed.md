When a symbol is ambiguous to a lesser extent or unambiguous, a state cloud of all its exemplars' contextual embeddings appears to be well-formed.

This means that this state cloud can be accurately described by means of a high-dimensional ellipsoid, and, as [[a-conceptor-represents-a-higher-dimensional-ellipsoid]], by conceptors.

[[@bricmanNestedStateClouds2022]]: "While we employ conceptors as compact elliptical objects which approximate high-dimensional state clouds of contextual embeddings, their limited expressivity might fail to capture the intricate non-linear layout of real-world embeddings. Lowdimensional PCA projections of several state clouds of BERT embeddings radically diverge from Gaussian distributions, bringing into question the suitability of elliptical conceptors to represent them (see Figure 4.2). However, we note that state clouds of less ambiguous terms (i.e. limited number of word senses) appear more well-formed. Nonlinearities might arise mainly from diverse word senses being assumed by the same symbols."
