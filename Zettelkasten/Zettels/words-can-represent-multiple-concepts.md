A word or symbol (textual representation of a concept) can actually represent multiple concepts: Symbols can be ambiguous. Common ambiguities:
- Many English nouns can also be used as verb (the plant / to plant)
- Nouns can have different meanings (plant as in vegetal organism, or plant as in factory, or...)
