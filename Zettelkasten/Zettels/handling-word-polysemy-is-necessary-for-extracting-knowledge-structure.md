If the goal of my thesis is to automatically create a "WordNet" from a large-text corpus, then is is *obvious* that we'll need to handle word polysemy to receive good output. 

Impact is twofold:
- Well-formedness of nested state clouds, as
	- [[state-cloud-of-ambiguous-symbol-is-ill-formed]] 
	- and [[unambiguous-state-clouds-appear-well-formed]]
- Interpretability of resulting knowledge structure / ontology / wordnet
