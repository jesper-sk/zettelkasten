As [[words-can-represent-multiple-concepts]], a cloud of vector embeddings of instances of a word (symbol) can contain multiple clouds of the *same* symbol, but representing a *different* concept.

This makes such an ambiguous cloud not suitable to represent a single concept. Symbols should first be disambiguated before a vector cloud can represent a single concept. Relevant: [[unambiguous-state-clouds-appear-well-formed]]
